/**
 * A character posed directly on the rig, in its own space (feet at the origin, facing +z), by the scene that owns
 * it: joint turns, IK targets for the fists and feet, and the shape of each hand. Nothing here is translated from
 * the old six-part poses. On top of what the scene sets it keeps a light follow-through on the head and chest and
 * moves every finger on its own: each one is sprung towards the curl the hand's shape asks for, never holds quite
 * still, and a hand that changes shape closes from the knuckles, finger by finger.
 *
 * <p>The whole body's turn about the vertical ({@link #viewYaw}) and its lean ({@link #viewPitch}) are applied
 * when drawing, about the feet, so the IK targets can be given in the character's own space however it is turned.
